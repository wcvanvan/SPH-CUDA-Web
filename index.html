        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <p>We are going to implement an optimized Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) fluid
            solver on the NVIDIA GPUs in the lab. Specifically we are simulating water flowing down the trough into a
            sink as shown in the image below.</p>

        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p> In SPH, fluids are represented by particles, and each particle carries properties such
            as mass, position, velocity and so on. The fundamental idea is to estimate fluid properties at any point by
            averaging the contributions from neighboring particles.
            </br>
            A block diagram of SPH is shown below. Every particle does pressure calculation, force computation, and time
            integration independently, so parallelism can be fully exploited in these steps.

        <h2>THE CHALLENGE</h2>
        <p>Most challenges lie in the step of density calculation</p>
        <p>1. NEIGHBOR SEARCH IN IRREGULAR 3D SPACE: One major challenge is to efficiently
            find neighbors for each particle. In dynamic simulations, particles move freely,
            creating constantly changing neighborhoods that can't be predicted in advance. A brute-force approach of
            checking every particle against every other particle results in O(N²) complexity, which becomes expensive as
            particle counts increase into the thousands.</p>
        <p>2. COMMUNICATION AND DATA DEPENDENCIES: Density calculation requires each particle to gather position data
            from all its neighbors, creating significant communication overhead. This data dependency means particles
            cannot be processed independently, leading to potential bottlenecks in parallel implementations. The
            irregular memory access patterns also hurt cache performance, further reducing computational efficiency.</p>
        <p>3. KERNEL EVALUATION OVERHEAD: Each neighbor interaction requires evaluating complex smoothing kernel
            functions involving square roots and high-order polynomials. These mathematical operations are
            computationally expensive when performed thousands of times per simulation step.</p>
        <p>4. LOAD BALANCING: The varying number of neighbors per particle creates
            significant load imbalance. Some threads finish quickly while others lag behind, reducing overall
            utilization of computational resources. This thread divergence is particularly problematic on GPU
            architectures designed for uniform workloads.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Computers: GHC Computers with NVIDIA GPUs</li>
                <li>Starter code: Start from scratch</li>

            <h2>GOALS AND DELIVERABLES</h2>
            <p><strong>Plan to achieve:</strong> Simulate water flowing down the trough into the sink </p>
            <p><strong>Hope to achieve:</strong> Turn the trough into a curved pipe which is a more complex geometry
            </p>
            <p><strong>Fallback goals:</strong> Only simulate water flowing in a rectangular sink, which is a trivial task as Grid Solver</p>
            <p><strong>Poster session targets:</strong> Run real-time water simulation demo </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>PLATFORM CHOICE</h2>
            <p>In fluid simulation, thousands of particles are required as a minimum for a decent demo. Nvidia RTX 2080
                can easily handle thousands of concurrent threads, which perfectly suits our needs. </p>
